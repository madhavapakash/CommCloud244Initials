    <description>JSON field with the following structure: {&quot;[childProductId]&quot;: [quantity], ....} that describes the child item quantities that roll-up to the quantity of this item. For example, {&quot;01t0O00000BPrs1QAD&quot;:1,&quot;01t0O00000BPrrwQAD&quot;:1}. The quantity value is the sum of quantities for that product across all instances on the child assets. For example, if two child assets exist of type Product A, the first with quantity 2 and the second with quantity 1, the map quantity for Product A should be 3. Helps CPQ identify quantities and enforce cardinality rules. Must be populated for all assets that have direct children, but it does not need to be populated for virtual products or assets with no children. Also, child virtual products should not be included in the map on their parent asset.</description>
